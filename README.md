# Osu! Songs Exporter

This project does this: `osu! --> music folder`

It's useful if you want to listen beatmaps you have already installed to be available to some external player, ran as in:

```sh
cargo run ~/.osu /run/media/$USER/my_mp3_player/ -a
```

It was tested on Linux and supports as input both osu! 4.0 (stable branch) and lazer.
